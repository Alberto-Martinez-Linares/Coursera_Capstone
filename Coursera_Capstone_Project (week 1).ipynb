Even the WHO sets ambitious goals such as reducing the number of deaths and injuries from traffic accidents worldwide by almost half.\n- Traffic accidents cost most countries 3% of their GDP.\n- More than half of deaths from traffic accidents affect \"vulnerable road users\", that is, pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.\n- Despite the fact that low- and middle-income countries have approximately 60% of the world's vehicles, they account for more than 93% of deaths related to road accidents.\n- Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death in children and young people between the ages of 5 and 29.\n\n#### In particular for our case:\n\nAs for our business case, we are going to focus on the city of Seattle. Our audience in this case is the city council, its mayor and politicians want to solve the big problem of traffic accidents and seek analysis in the available data to be able to implement security measures and applications that help to reduce to the greatest extent possible traffic accidents and its severity."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n\n#### Brief Description\nWe need to work on finding the severity of damage caused by accidents and for that we will require a large number of reports on traffic accidents so we can work on a prediction model. The data set provided for this exercise have around 195,000 accidents in the state of Seattle (location in which our focus will be for this exercise), from 2004 to the date it is issued (in 2020), and in which 37 attributes are recorded, such as location, collision type, date, weather, road conditions, etc. The dependent variable, SEVERITYCODE, contains numbers that correspond to different severity level caused by the accident. '1' indicates property damage only collision, and '2' indicates injury collision.\n\n#### Data Source\nThese data have been collected and shared by the Seattle Police Department (Traffic Records)and we have access to the records using the given link.\n\n##### Data set name\nData-Collisions\n\n#### Usage\nThe data will be used so that we can determine which attributes are most common in traffic accidents in order to target prevention at which are the riskiest points or locations where they happened. We will be able to provide recommendations based on severity of the accidents so far (for what we have data), location of them, weather conditions in which these took place, etc"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
